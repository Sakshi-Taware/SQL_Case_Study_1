#9.  If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
SELECT
  s.customer_id,
  SUM(
    CASE 
      WHEN m.product_name = 'sushi' THEN 2 * m.price
      ELSE m.price
    END
  ) * 10 AS total_points
FROM
  sales s
JOIN
  menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY
  s.customer_id
ORDER BY
  s.customer_id;
